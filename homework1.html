<h1> Patrick Young.</h1>
    
      <p>I don't want to be someone that you're settling for. I don't want to be someone that anyone settles for.</p>
    
      <p>People who truly loved once are far more likely to love again.</p>
    
      <p> But through it all the key for me has been bravery and the deep-down knowledge that I am better than everyone else.</p>
    
      <p>No man or woman is worth your tears,and the one who is,won’t make you cry.</p>
